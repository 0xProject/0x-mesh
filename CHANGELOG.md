# CHANGELOG

This changelog is a work in progress and may contain notes for versions which have not actually been released. Check the [Releases](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/releases) page to see full release notes and more information about the latest released versions.

## v4.0.0-beta

### Breaking changes üõ† 

- Renamed the environment variable `P2P_LISTEN_PORT` to `P2P_TCP_PORT` ([#366](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/366)). This makes it possible to configure Mesh to use both the TCP and Websocket transports by listening on different ports.

### Features ‚úÖ 

- Enabled WebSocket transport for bootstrap nodes and all other nodes ([#361](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/361), [#363](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/363), [#366](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/366)). By default the WebSocket transport listens on port `60559` but this can be changed via the `P2P_WEBSOCKETS_PORT` environment variable.
- Created TypeScript bindings and an NPM package for running Mesh directly in the browser ([#369](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/369)). Documentation for the NPM package and a guide for running Mesh in the browser can be found at [https://0x-org.gitbook.io/mesh/](https://0x-org.gitbook.io/mesh/).
- Added ability to use custom bootstrap list via the `BOOTSTRAP_LIST` environment variable ([#374](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/374)). Typically this should only be used for testing/debugging.
- Added WebAssembly/Browser support to packages that previously did not support it ([#358](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/358), [#359](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/359), [#366](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/366)).
- Order hash calculations are now cached, which slightly improves performance ([#365](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/365)).
- Refactored `BlockWatch` so that it can be used without using `LevelDB` for Ethereum block storage. ([#355](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/355))

### Bug fixes üêû 

- Fixed two related bugs: One where order expiration events would be emitted multiple times and another that meant subsequent fill/cancel events for orders deemed expired were not emitted. Fills/cancels for expired orders will continue to be emitted if they occur within ~4 mins (i.e. 20 blocks) of the expiration ([#385](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/385)).
- Fixed a data race-condition in OrderWatcher that could have caused order collection updates to be overwritten in the DB. ([#386](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/386))
- Fixed a bug where `fillableTakerAssetAmount` and `lastUpdated` were not always being properly updated in the DB. ([#386](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/386))
- Fixed some issues with key prefixes for certain types not being applied correctly to logs ([#375](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/375)).
- Fixed an issue where order hashes were not being correctly logged ([#368](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/368)).
- Mesh will now properly shut down if the database is unexpectedly closed ([#370](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/370)).

## v3.0.1-beta

## v3.0.1-beta

### Bug fixes üêû 

- Fixed bug where block number would sometimes be converted to hex with a leading zero, an invalid hex value per the [Ethereum JSON-RPC specification](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#hex-value-encoding). ([#353](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/353))
- Fixed bug which resulted in orders that were close to expiring being re-added and removed multiple times, resulting in multiple ADDED and EXPIRED events for the same order ([#352](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/352)).

## v3.0.0-beta

### Breaking changes üõ† 

- Modified Mesh's validation logic to reject and consider invalid any _partially fillable_ orders. While this is
  technically a breaking change, partially fillable orders are rare in the wild and we don't expect this will
  affect many users. ([#333](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/333))
- Lowercased `GetStatsAsync` method to `getStatsAsync` in TS client

### Bug fixes üêû 

- De-dup order submitted via the JSON-RPC method `mesh_addOrders` before performing validation ([#331](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/331))
- Added `"declaration": true,` to TS client's `tsconfig.json` so that downstream projects can use it's TS typings. ([#325](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/325))


## v2.0.0-beta

### Breaking changes üõ† 

- Modified how `mesh_addOrders` treats orders that are already stored on the Mesh node. Previously, they would be rejected with code `OrderAlreadyStored`. Now, if the order is stored and fillable, it will be accepted. If it is stored but unfillable, it will be rejected with `OrderAlreadyStoredAndUnfillable`. We additionally added a `isNew` property to the accepted orderInfos returned, so that callers can discern which orders Mesh already knew about. ([#316](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/316))

### Features ‚úÖ 

- Added backup bootstrap nodes provided by the libp2p community
- Improved log formatting and reduced verbosity in a few cases ([#314](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/314), [#287](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/287))
- Reduced AdvertiseBootDelay for bootstrap nodes
- Implemented a check that will alerts you when switching to a different Ethereum network ID. ([#301](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/301)) -- special thanks to @hrharder!
- Made environment variable parsing more generous by automatically removing quotes if needed ([#306](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/306))
- Improved tests by adding timeouts and closing resources where appropriate ([#310](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/310), [#309](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/309), [#308](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/308))
- Increased robustness by removing panics and failing more gracefully ([#312](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/312))
- RPC server is now started while block event backfilling is happening under the hood instead of waiting for it to complete ([#318](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/318))
- Added a `mesh_getStats` endpoint which returns a host of useful information about the state of the Mesh node (e.g., number of fillable order stored, number of peers, peerID, etc...) ([#322](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/322))

### Bug fixes üêû 

- Log messages are no longer incorrectly fired when receiving orders which have already been seen ([#286](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/286))
- Fixed a bug where Mesh was still running after the database was closed ([#300](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/300))
- Handled Parity "unknown block" error gracefully like we do Geth's ([#285](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/285))

## v1.0.6-beta

This release fixes several bugs:

- Uninitialized TxHashes map & accidental inclusion of null address txHash in order events ([#280](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/280))
- Concurrent read/write issue in OrderWatcher's EventDecoder ([#278](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/issues/278))
- Non-unique logging keys causing Elastic Search indexing issues ([#275](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/275))

It also includes a reduction in the delay before which bootstrap nodes advertise themselves as relays from 15mins to 30sec.

## v1.0.5-beta

This version introduces a temporary hack in order to help some Mesh nodes find their public IP address under certain circumstances.

## v1.0.4-beta

This release fixes a bug in how AutoNAT and AutoRelay services were discovered.

## v1.0.3-beta

This release fixes some networking related issues with our bootstrap nodes.

- Bootstrap nodes now advertise the correct public IP address.
- Bootstrap nodes now also operate as a relay.

These fixes will help smooth out any issues with peer discovery.

## v1.0.2-beta

This release fixes a few minor bugs and includes additional documentation.

1. Set a custom protocol ID for our DHT in order to separate it from the default IPFS DHT.
2. Fixed a bug in the getOrders JSON-RPC endpoint where fillableTakerAssetAmount was sometimes being encoded as numbers instead of strings.
3. Converted addresses to all lowercase (non-checksummed) in the JSON-RPC API.
4. Improved logging.
5. Added a guide for running a Mesh node with telemetry-enabled.


## v1.0.1-beta

This release adds AutoNAT support for our bootstrap nodes. This enables peers who are behind NATs to find each and connect to each other (in most cases).

In addition, this release includes some changes to default network timeouts and documentation improvements.

## v1.0.0-beta

This is the initial beta release for 0x Mesh!

This release supports the following features:

- Automatic peer discovery via a DHT.
- A JSON-RPC endpoint for interacting with your Mesh node. It includes support for adding new orders and subscribing to order updates.
- Efficient order validation and order watching under the hood. You will get notified quickly when orders are expired, canceled, or filled.
- Basic limitations on the size and types of messages sent by peers. Peers that send malformed messages or messages that are too big will be dropped.

In addition to improving stability and scalability we plan to release many more important features in the near future. Check out https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/issues for more information about what we are working on.
