## 0x Mesh

0x Mesh is a peer-to-peer network for sharing orders that adhere to the [0x order message format](https://0x.org/docs/guides/v2-specification#order-message-format).

WARNING: This project is still under active development. Expect breaking changes before the official release.

### Overview

0x Mesh has a lot of different use cases for different categories of users:

* Relayers can use Mesh to share orders with one another and to receive orders

  from market makers. This allows them to increase the depth of their order

  books and provide a better user experience.

* Market makers can use Mesh to reach a broader audience. Their orders will be

  sent throughout the network and are more likely to be filled.

* Mesh allows for a new type of relayer called a "serverless relayer". In the

  serverless relayer model, each user runs Mesh in their browser and there is

  no backend server or database. Instead, peers share orders directly with one

  another. \(There are pros and cons to this approach and it is probably not

  suitable for all markets\).

Both Relayers and Market makers can use Mesh to watch a set of orders for changes in fillability \(e.g., cancellations, fills, expirations, etc...\).

0x Mesh is intended to be entirely automatic. It takes care of all the work of receiving, sharing, and validating orders so that you can focus on building your application. When you run a 0x Mesh node, it will automatically discover peers in the network and begin receiving orders from and sending orders to them. You do not need to know the identities \(e.g., IP address or domain name\) of any peers in the network ahead of time and they do not need to know about you.

Developers can use the JSON-RPC API to interact with a Mesh node that they control. The API allows you to send orders into the network, receive any new orders, and get notified when the status of an existing order changes \(e.g. when it is filled, canceled, or expired\). Under the hood, Mesh performs efficient order validation and order book pruning, which takes out a lot of the hard work for developers.
