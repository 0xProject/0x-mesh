## @0x/mesh-browser-lite

This packages provides a set of Typescript and Javascript bindings for running a 0x-mesh node in the browser.
The browser node's Wasm binary is not bundled in this package and is instead expected to be served by the
consumer of the package. This package is lighter-weight than the `@0x/mesh-browser` package and may have faster load times.
