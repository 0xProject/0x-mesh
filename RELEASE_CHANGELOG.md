## Summary

### Bug fixes üêû

- Fix bug where we weren't enforcing that we never store more than `miniHeaderRetentionLimit` block headers in the DB. This caused [issue #667](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/issues/667) and also caused the Mesh node's DB storage to continuously grow over time. ([#716](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/pull/716))
